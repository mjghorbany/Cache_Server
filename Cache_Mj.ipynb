    "## KeyValueStore Server with Transactions and Concurrency\n",
    "This is an in-memory key-value store that supports basic CRUD operations (PUT, GET, DELETE) and transaction management. The server supports multiple clients and ensures thread safety using locks. Each client or thread can start a transaction, commit, or rollback changes, all managed independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The server communicates over sockets using simple text commands and JSON responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features:\n",
    "* Basic operations: PUT, GET, DEL\n",
    "* Transaction support: START, COMMIT, ROLLBACK\n",
    "* Thread-safe design to handle multiple clients concurrently\n",
    "* Sockets for client-server communication\n",
    "\n",
    "### Commands\n",
    "Here is a list of supported commands:\n",
    "* PUT [key] [value]: Adds or updates a key-value pair.\n",
    "* GET [key]: Retrieves the value for a given key.\n",
    "* DEL [key]: Deletes a key-value pair.\n",
    "* START: Begins a transaction for the current thread/client.\n",
    "* COMMIT: Commits changes made during a transaction.\n",
    "* ROLLBACK: Discards changes made during a transaction.\n",
    "* The server responds with JSON results, providing either the status or the result of the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Server\n",
    "Uncomment the server startup lines in the if __name__ == \"__main__\": block\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    HOST = '127.0.0.1'  # Localhost\n",
    "    PORT = 65432  # Arbitrary non-privileged port\n",
    "    start_server(HOST, PORT)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Client\n",
    "You can use a simple socket client or a tool like `telnet` or `nc` to send commands to the server.\n",
    "`nc 127.0.0.1 65432`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you can start sending commands like:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "PUT mykey myvalue\n",
    "GET mykey\n",
    "START\n",
    "PUT tempkey tempvalue\n",
    "COMMIT\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
